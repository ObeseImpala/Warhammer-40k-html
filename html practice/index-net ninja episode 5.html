        <p>The Age of the Imperium is the time period that began with the end of the Horus Heresy in the early 31st Millennium, and is typically referred to in the present tense.
             The approximate time period begins in 014.M31, and continues forward to the present, with the last year represented in Imperial records before the opening 
             of the Great Rift and the start of the Era Indomitus being 999.M41.</p>
        
        <p class="error">The Age of the Imperium is generally conveyed as spanning from the end of the Horus Heresy to the narrative present -- 
            a period of approximately ten thousand Terran years.</p>

        <p class="success">During the Time of Rebirth the Imperium of Man slowly recovered from the destruction and loss of the Horus Heresy. The myriad wars of the Great Scouring were
             fought in the years immediately after the end of the Horus Heresy and the death of the traitorous Warmaster Horus.</p>

             <p class="success feedback">For a time after the end of the wars of the Scouring and the retreat of the Traitors into the Eye of Terror, the Imperium knew peace from the corrupted
                 followers of the Chaos Gods. At the same time, many alien species that had been fought during the Great Crusade reappeared in Human space to take
                  advantage of the disruptions caused by the Horus Heresy. They soon plagued the vulnerable worlds of Mankind already prostrate from the destruction 
                  wrought by the Heresy.</p>
